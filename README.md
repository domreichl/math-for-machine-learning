# math-for-machine-learning

This Python repository collects mathematical concepts that are essential for machine learning:
- The main file **math_for_machine_learning.py** imports all other files as modules and runs exemplaric function calls.
- The module **elementary_algebra** provides two functions for plotting degree 1 and 2 polynomials: linear with slope and intercepts; quadratic with intercepts, vertex, and line of symmetry.
- The module **linear_algebra** provides
  - three functions for plotting vectors, calculating their magnitude and direction, vector addition, and vector multiplication,
  - a function for processing matrices with six operations (addition, subtraction, negation, transposition, multiplication, and division),
  - a function for solving systems of equations with matrices, and
  - a function for calculating eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs.
- The modules **differential_calculus**, **integral_calculus**, and **statistics_fundamentals** are not written yet.

Required third-party modules are *pandas* (for data frames), *numpy* (for vectors and matrices), and *matplotlib* (for graphs).
