# math-for-machine-learning

This repository collects mathematical concepts that are essential for machine learning and expresses them with Python code:
- The main file **math_for_machine_learning.py** imports all other files as modules.
- The module **elementary_algebra** provides functions for plotting degree 1 and 2 polynomials (linear and quadratic functions).
- The modules *linear_algebra*, *differential_calculus*, *integral_calculus*, *statistics_fundamentals*, and *probability* are not written yet.
