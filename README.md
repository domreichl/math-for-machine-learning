# math-for-machine-learning

This repository collects mathematical concepts that are essential for machine learning and expresses them in Python 3 code:
- The main file **math_for_machine_learning.py** imports all other files as modules.
- The module **elementary_algebra** provides functions for plotting degree 1 and 2 polynomials (linear and quadratic functions).
- The modules **linear_algebra**, **differential_calculus**, **integral_calculus**, **statistics_fundamentals**, and **probability** are not written yet.

Requires third-party modules **pandas** and **matplotlib**.
